/**
 * Annotation which indicates that a class and/or method are part of the supported Geomajas API.
 * <p/>
 * Only classes and methods with this annotation are guaranteed to be supported for increasing versions with the same
 * major version number.
 * <p/>
 * When the class is annotated, "allMethods" can be used to indicate that the annotation also applies to all public
 * methods in the class (or interface). When this is not used, the class is guaranteed to exist, but the individual
 * supported methods also need to be annotated. Note that the annotation explicitly does not apply for inner classes,
 * they need explicit annotation.
