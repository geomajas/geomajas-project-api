/**
 * Annotation which indicates that a class and/or method are planned to be part of the supported Geomajas API.
 * <p/>
 * This is an annotation to indicate that this should be part of the API, but there is still some room for discussion
 * or validation before changing to {@link Api}.
 * <p/>
 * The intention is that these annotations only remain for a short time, either removing the annotation or changing to
 * {@link Api}. In principle this should be checked before a release. It is recommended to add some comments to
 * indicate why it is not yet @Api and/or indicate when it should become {@link Api}.
